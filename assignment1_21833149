Why we need a Database Management System instead of a spreadsheet? Advantages and disadvantages of DBMS compared to a spreadsheet

1.Databases provide a flexibility to sort and present data in a myriad of ways that would be nearly impossible to do with two-dimensional spreadsheets. Many databases also provide means to automate query and report generation using stored procedures.
2.In a database, the regulatory standards would be updated in one table and would be available for any reporting queries of the associated data. In addition, a database can update records in bulk.
3.When a spreadsheet has many fields or a large amount of data (1000s of rows), the spreadsheet can be hard to read. Finding specific data can be cumbersome. Relational databases use querying tools to overcome these issues.
4.Spreadsheets are great for numeric and text values in relatively low volume. Databases also expertly handle numeric and text values but can easily incorporate other types of information.

 
Why we need a database management system ? Let me summarize:
A database ensures that data is stored in a specific field. With this system, which is especially used in government institutions, many data can be easily stored. Many organizations use this system, which has been adapted to a certain order.
Thanks to the database, the information of millions of people can be reached in a short time. With this system, it has become possible for the services provided in civil registration offices, school records, banks and many similar institutions to be more practical.
The database system, which is a very important issue for a software developer or web programmer, has an improvable structure. In this way, any project can progress to advanced stages much more easily.
